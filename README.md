Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Radio Station Analysis using Python

Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing data from a provided dataset containing information from various sources. The primary objectives are to clean, reshape, and conduct statistical analyses to derive meaningful insights.

Goals

Data Cleaning
Identify and handle missing values, anomalies, and errors in the dataset.
Ensure the data is fit for analysis by correcting and removing inconsistent entries.
Data Reshaping
Reshape the data based on requirements, including restructuring columns or combining data from different resources.
Statistical Analysis
Develop and test functions for statistical analysis, including mean, mode, and median calculations for specific columns.
Visualization
Produce suitable graphs displaying information extracted from DAB Multiplexes.
Explore visualizations to demonstrate correlations and trends within the data.
Graphic User Interface (GUI)
Develop a seamless GUI for interacting with data.
Allow users to easily load, clean, and save datasets.
Implement features to manipulate and visualize the data range.
File Handling
Allow users to load and save datasets in different file formats such as CSV, JSON, or XML.
