# DAB Radio Station Analysis with Python
Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) Radio Station Analysis using Python

**Introduction**
This project is designed for cleaning and analyzing data from a given dataset. The dataset includes information from various sources, and the goal is to clean, reshape, and perform statistical analysis to derive meaningful insights.

**Goals**
Data Cleaning - identify and handle missing values, anomolies, and errors in the dataset, and ensure the data is fit for analysis by correcting and removing inconsistent entries.
Data Reshaping - Reshape the data based on the requirements, which might involve restructuring columns or combining data from different resources.
Statistical Analysis - Develop and test functions for statistical analysis, including mean, mode, and median calculations for specific columns.
Visualisation- produce suitable graphs that display information extracted from DAB Multiplexes, and explore visualisations to demonstrate correlations and trends within the data.
Graphic User Interface (GUI) - an seamless GUI developed for interacting with the data, allowing users to easily load, clean and save datasets, and implement features to manipulate and visialise the data range.
File Handling - allow users to load and save datasets in different file formats such as CSV, JSON or XML.

**Technologies Used:**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: 
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - NumPy: For numerical operations.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualisation.
  - Tkinter: For GUI development.

File Formats: 
  CSV: For storing and reading tabular data.
  JSON: For a lightweight data interchange format.

Development Environment:
  Jupyter Notebook: For interactive and collaborative data analysis.


**Design**
The project follows a modular design, separating concerns for data cleaning, reshaping, analysis, and visualisation. The GUI provides a seamless experience for users, enabling them to perform tasks intuitively.
